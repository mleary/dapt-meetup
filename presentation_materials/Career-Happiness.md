Looking for a job is tough. You know that you need to use your network, but what if you don’t have a network?  I ran into this problem and even discussed it in my blog about my data journey.  Here are 5 messages you can use to reach out to someone you don’t know to start networking today.

## New Career

Hi FIRST NAME,

I'm reaching out to you because you are at JOBTITLE and it looks like we have some common connections including LARRY, MOE and CURLEY. I know LARRY from SCHOOL and I graduated high school with CURLY.

I'm considering making a career shift into JOBTITLE. However, I don't know much about the position and was hopeful to meet someone in the industry. If you are open to sharing some thoughts I would love to meet you for coffee or lunch one day. If that is not possible maybe we could schedule some time for a phone call.

I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing back from you.

## Interested in Company

Hi NAME,

I’m currently in a CURRENTROLE at CURRENTCOMPANY and am interested in the type of work you do at NEWCOMPANY as a NEWROLE.  I was hoping I could pick your brain over coffee or at lunch one day to get your thoughts about the company and how you like it there.

I’m free WEEKDAY if that works for you.  Otherwise let me know what might work best!

## Going to Apply

Hi RECRUITER,

I’m very interested in the POSITION at COMPANY.  I wanted to connect with you prior to applying to make sure the position was still open and learn more about the role.  I’d also be open to any feedback on my resume prior to applying, so that I can make sure my application is as strong as possible.  

Please let me know if we can schedule some time to chat or if I can pass along my resume.

Thanks!


## Staying in Touch  

Hi NAME!

I’m not sure if you’ll remember me, but we met at EVENT.  I really enjoyed talking with you and would like to learn more about what you do. Also, I’m so happy at COMPANY, I thought you might want to learn more about it in case you were looking for a new opportunity.

Does coffee on WEEKDAY work for you?

Talk to you soon,

## Reconnecting

Hi NAME!

I can’t believe it’s been DAYS/MONTHS/YEARS since we TOOKCLASS/EVENT/GRADUATED together. I’m loving life over at COMPANY and hope you are having fun at your COMPANY.  I feel like you would love ROLE here.  I’m also curious about ROLES at your COMPANY.  What day would work to get coffee or lunch one day?  

I can’t wait to catch up!
